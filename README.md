# QA-DevOps\_Learning-Path

Welcome to my **QA-DevOps Journey** repository! This is a personal learning and project showcase space where I document my progress, projects, and experiments in **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **DevOps** practices. The repository includes resources, code, and projects related to various testing methodologies and tools I am learning and applying.

## About the Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my journey in mastering QA and DevOps concepts. It contains code, scripts, configurations, and documentation for projects involving manual testing, automation testing, performance testing, and DevOps tools. My goal is to learn, implement, and share knowledge about the following areas:

* **Manual Testing**: Test cases, test plans, and bug reports.
* **Automation Testing**: Scripts and frameworks using tools like Selenium.
* **Performance Testing**: Load, stress, and spike testing using JMeter.
* **API Testing**: API testing and validation with Postman.
* **Security Testing**: Exploring tools like Burp Suite for security testing.
* **Regression Testing**: Ensuring software stability through regression test suites.
* **DevOps Tools**: CI/CD pipelines and automation with Jenkins.
* **Other Tools and Practices**: Exploring additional tools and methodologies as I progress.
